## [6.0.13] - 2018-09-25

This major release aligns Gherkin with [Example Mapping](https://cucumber.io/blog/2015/12/08/example-mapping-introduction),
a collaborative technique for *designing* scenarios and discovering details
about rules and behaviour.

A new `Rule` keyword has been introduced, and acts as a grouping of one or more
`Example`s - a new synonym for `Scenario`. The `Scenario Outline` keyword can now
be interchanged with the `Scenario` keyword, which makes Gherkin a little less confusing,
especially to beginners. These are the first major change to the
Gherkin grammar in 8 years or so, and we're pretty excited about them. We hope they will
guide people towards thinking of scenarios as *examples of business rules*
rather than a series of form submissions and link clicking. This rule-focused
style engages product owners, and can act as amazing living documentation of your
product. It opens up for the true benefits of BDD - a business-friendly format
for describing and agreeing on software behaviour, and a guide to development.
Developers will code against this spec, and produce better (simpler) software faster.
The software will do what it says on the tin.

The new Gherkin grammar is backwards compatible, meaning that existing Gherkin
documents are still valid.

The library API however is not backwards compatible. It is now a stream-like
API which produces a stream of messages (source, AST and pickle messages).

Internally, each library shells out to a go executable (embedded in the library for all major
OSes and processor architectures), and communicates via STDIN/STDOUT using
[protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/). The rationale
behind this architectural change is to reduce the maintenance burden (a single parser
rather than a dozen), but also to make it quicker and easier to implement a Gherkin
library in a new language. Just generate some protobuf classes/structs and write a
small program that shells out and communicates using those messages.

Our preliminary benchmarks suggest that performance is comparable to the native implementations,
or better. There is a small hit in startup cost, but this is offset against a higher throughput
of the parser.

At the time of this writing Gherkin 6 is nearly integrated in Cucumber-JVM and
Cucumber-Ruby. Integration with Cucumber.js has not started and we would really
welcome some help with that.

The message protocol will continue to evolve to represent runtime information such
as results, parameter types, cucumber expressions and other metadata. This will
make it easier for the community to build plugins for Cucumber. One HTML Gherkin
formatter to rule them all. Statistic plugins and more.

* Added `Rule` keyword
  ([#250](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/issues/250)

## [4.0.0] - 2016-04-10

This is a major release because of two backwards-incompatible changes.

First, the AST returned by the parser is a `GherkinDocument` node, with a `feature`
property pointing to a `Feature` node. Prior to this release the parser would return
a `Feature` node.

Second, the `Feature` node now has an array/list of `children` that are `Background`,
`Scenario` or `ScenarioOutline`.

Other noteworthy changes is several minor improvements to bring the grammar closer
to Gherkin 2.
