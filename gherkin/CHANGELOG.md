   [aslakhellesoy]
   [ciaranmcnulty])

## [17.0.0] - 2021-02-07

### Changed
* [JavaScript] the `GherkinStreams` object is not longer loaded by default.
  This makes it possible to use the library in a browser without a polyfill.
  To upgrade, use `import GherkinStreams from '@cucumber/gherkin/dist/src/stream/GherkinStreams'` instead of `import { GherkinStreams } from 'gherkin'`.
  ([#1333](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/1333))
* [Perl] Fully overhauled implementation, moving it up from 4.0.0
  ([#711](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/711),
   [#1286](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/1286)) [ehuelsmann]

### Removed
* [JavaScript] remove `IGherkinOptions#createReadStream`. This function was introduced in `9.1.0`
  in order to decouple this lib from the Node.js `fs` library. This decoupling was improved in
  [#1333](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/1333) which made it obsolete.
  (Fixes [#1284](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/issues/1284)

### Fixed
* Use Spanish translation for the "Rule" keyword and for the "Feature" synonym keywords
  ([#1360](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/1360)
   [sergioforerogomez])
* Use Italian translation for the "Rule" keyword and for the "Feature" synonym keywords
  ([#1318](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/1318)
   [mgiustiniani])
* Use Swedish translation for the "Rule" keyword
  ([#1297](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/1297)
   [johnknoop])
* Elixir implementation - make sure the gherkin_languages.json is added with the release package.
  ([#1293](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/1293)
   [WannesFransen1994])
* [JavaScript] removed circular dependencies.
  ([#1292](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/1292)
   [davidjgoss]
   [aslakhellesoy])

## [16.0.0] - 2020-12-10

### Added

* [Elixir] New implementation!
  ([#1251](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/1251)
   [WannesFransen1994])

### Changed

* Telugu now uses the correct 639-1 code - `te` instead of `tl`.
  ([#1238](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/1238)
   [#1221](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/issues/1221)
   [nvmkpk])

### Removed

* [JavaScript] The `Query` class has been removed from this library, and has been added to `@cucumber/gherkin-utils`

## [15.0.2] - 2020-08-17

### Fixed

* Revert removal of Gherkin keywords from 15.0.1

## [15.0.1] - 2020-08-12

Do not use this release. The removal of Gherkin keywords breaks backwards compatibility for Creole and French,
and this should have been released as a major release. The keywords are restored in 15.0.2, and we'll remove them
again in a future major release.

### Removed

* Remove keyword aliases that only differ by letter case (French, Creole).
  The reason for this is that Cucumber-JVM generates annotation classes for each
  step keyword, and some file systems are case insensitive. This led to inconsistencies
  in the classes that were generated during the build. Removing these keywords fixes
  this problem. Theoretically this should trigger a new major release, but because the
  change is so minor and will affect very few users we've made this a patch release.

## [15.0.0] - 2020-08-07

* Update `messages` to 13.0.1

## [14.2.0] - 2020-07-31

  ([#1102](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/1102/)
   [mpkorstanje])
## [14.0.1] - 2020-06-29

### Fixed

  ([cucumber-ruby#1427](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/issues/1427)
   [vincent-psarga])
* [JavaScript] Change gherkinQuery API:
  * `getPickleIds`: now takes a URI and an `astNodeId` to find the pickle ids instead of a line number
  * `getPickleStepIds`: now takes an `astNodeId` parameter instead of a URL and a line number to locate the pickle step id
  * expose `parse` and `parseAndCompile` utilities

* [JavaScript] Export `compile` function for compiling `Pickles`

### Changed

* Upgrade to messages 11.x
* [JavaScript] The default export has been removed. Replaced with:
  * `import { GherkinStreams } from 'gherkin'` to use the `fromPaths`, `fromStream`  and `fromSources` functions
  * `import { dialects } from 'gherkin'` to access dialects
* [JavaScript] `Dialect` properties are read only
* [JavaScript] `fromPaths`, `fromStream` and `fromSources` now use `ReadOnlyArray` to
  prevent modifying the passed array.

### Fixed

* [JavaScript] `Gherkin.fromPaths` is not a function
  ([#857](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/issues/857)
   [#949](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/949)
   [aslakhellesoy])

* [JavaScript] Add `getPickleStepIds(uri: string, lineNumber: number): string[]``

### Changed

## [9.1.0] - 2020-01-10

### Added

* [Ruby] Added `Gherkin::Query` that provides `Location` for various AST nodes.
  ([#845](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/845)
   [aslakhellesoy]
   [mattwynne]
   [vincent-psarga])

### Changed

* Upgrade to `messages` `9.0.1`
* [JavaScript] the `Gherkin#fromStream`, `Gherkin#fromPaths` and `Gherkin#fromSources` functions'
  `options` argument is no longer optional, and it *must* have a `createReadStream` property.
  The reason for this is to decouple the library from Node's `fs` module so it can be packaged with
  Webpack and be used in a browser.

## [6.0.13] - 2018-09-25

This major release aligns Gherkin with [Example Mapping](https://cucumber.io/blog/2015/12/08/example-mapping-introduction),
a collaborative technique for *designing* scenarios and discovering details
about rules and behaviour.

A new `Rule` keyword has been introduced, and acts as a grouping of one or more
`Example`s - a new synonym for `Scenario`. The `Scenario Outline` keyword can now
be interchanged with the `Scenario` keyword, which makes Gherkin a little less confusing,
especially to beginners. These are the first major change to the
Gherkin grammar in 8 years or so, and we're pretty excited about them. We hope they will
guide people towards thinking of scenarios as *examples of business rules*
rather than a series of form submissions and link clicking. This rule-focused
style engages product owners, and can act as amazing living documentation of your
product. It opens up for the true benefits of BDD - a business-friendly format
for describing and agreeing on software behaviour, and a guide to development.
Developers will code against this spec, and produce better (simpler) software faster.
The software will do what it says on the tin.

The new Gherkin grammar is backwards compatible, meaning that existing Gherkin
documents are still valid.

The library API however is not backwards compatible. It is now a stream-like
API which produces a stream of messages (source, AST and pickle messages).

Internally, each library shells out to a go executable (embedded in the library for all major
OSes and processor architectures), and communicates via STDIN/STDOUT using
[protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/). The rationale
behind this architectural change is to reduce the maintenance burden (a single parser
rather than a dozen), but also to make it quicker and easier to implement a Gherkin
library in a new language. Just generate some protobuf classes/structs and write a
small program that shells out and communicates using those messages.

Our preliminary benchmarks suggest that performance is comparable to the native implementations,
or better. There is a small hit in startup cost, but this is offset against a higher throughput
of the parser.

At the time of this writing Gherkin 6 is nearly integrated in Cucumber-JVM and
Cucumber-Ruby. Integration with Cucumber.js has not started and we would really
welcome some help with that.

The message protocol will continue to evolve to represent runtime information such
as results, parameter types, cucumber expressions and other metadata. This will
make it easier for the community to build plugins for Cucumber. One HTML Gherkin
formatter to rule them all. Statistic plugins and more.

### Added
* (TypeScript) - Added TypeScript definitions (`.d.ts`) for Gherkin.
* Added `Rule` keyword
  ([#250](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/issues/250)
   [aslakhellesoy])
* Added `Example` as synonym for `Scenario` in English and many other languages.
  This is to align Gherkin with BDD and Example Mapping terminology.
  ([aslakhellesoy])
* Added `Ukoliko` as an additional synonym for `Given`, in Croatian.
  ([#480](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/480)
   [banovotz](https://github.com/banovotz))

### Changed
* (JavaScript,Java,Ruby) The native parsers are removed. Parsing is done by `gherkin-go`
  executables which are bundled with the published libraries.
  ([aslakhellesoy], [jaysonesmith])
* (JavaScript,Java,Ruby,Go) `Scenario` keyword (or `Example` keyword) can be used to create `Scenario Outline`.
  ([#353](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/353) [aslakhellesoy])

### Removed

## [4.0.0] - 2016-04-10

This is a major release because of two backwards-incompatible changes.

First, the AST returned by the parser is a `GherkinDocument` node, with a `feature`
property pointing to a `Feature` node. Prior to this release the parser would return
a `Feature` node.

Second, the `Feature` node now has an array/list of `children` that are `Background`,
`Scenario` or `ScenarioOutline`.

Other noteworthy changes is several minor improvements to bring the grammar closer
to Gherkin 2.
