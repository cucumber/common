## Run tests

### MacOS/Linux/Windows

Install the latest version of [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

At terminal, run `dart test` from this directory.

Alternatively, you can use an IDE that runs Dart projects, such as [IntelliJ Idea Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

The `dart test` command will run the unit tests and the Dart-transformed acceptance tests. 
This is good as a first pass check and for debugging.
