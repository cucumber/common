## [4.0.0] - 2016-04-10

This is a major release because of two backwards-incompatible changes.

First, the AST returned by the parser is a `GherkinDocument` node, with a `feature`
property pointing to a `Feature` node. Prior to this release the parser would return
a `Feature` node.

Second, the `Feature` node now has an array/list of `children` that are `Background`,
`Scenario` or `ScenarioOutline`.

Other noteworthy changes is several minor improvements to bring the grammar closer
to Gherkin 2.
