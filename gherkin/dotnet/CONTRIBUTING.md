## Run tests

### OS X/Linux

Install dependencies:

    install .NET Core 1.1.2 - https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/1.1.2-download.md
    
Just run `make` from this directory.

### Windows

## Make a release

If this is your first time, read through NuGet's guidelines for
[Creating and Publishing a Package](https://docs.nuget.org/create/creating-and-publishing-a-package).

    # Replace X.Y.Z with the version
    # Change version in `Gherkin\project.json`
    git clean -dfx
    dotnet pack -c Release Gherkin
    mono .nuget/NuGet.exe push Gherkin/bin/Release/Gherkin.X.Y.Z.nupkg
    git commit -am "Release X.Y.Z"
    git tag -a -m "Version X.Y.Z" vX.Y.Z
    git push
    git push --tags
