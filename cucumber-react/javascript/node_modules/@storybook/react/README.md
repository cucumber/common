# Storybook for React

Storybook for React is a UI development environment for your React components.
With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

Storybook runs outside of your app.
So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

## Getting Started

```sh
cd my-react-app
npx -p @storybook/cli sb init
```

Storybook also comes with a lot of [addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/introduction) and a great API to customize as you wish.
You can also build a [static version](https://storybook.js.org/basics/exporting-storybook) of your storybook and deploy it anywhere you want.

Here are some featured storybooks that you can reference to see how Storybook works:

## Create React App

Support for Create React App is handled by [`@storybook/preset-create-react-app`](https://github.com/storybookjs/presets/tree/master/packages/preset-create-react-app).

This preset enables support for all Create React App features, including Sass/SCSS and TypeScript.


## Typescript

If you are using Typescript, make sure you have the type definitions installed via `yarn add @types/node @types/react @types/storybook__react --dev`.
