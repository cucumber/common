# `babel-plugin-styled-components`

This plugin is a highly recommended supplement to the base styled-components library, offering some useful features:

- consistently hashed component classNames between environments (a must for server-side rendering)
- better debugging through automatic annotation of your styled components based on their context in the file system, etc.
- various types of minification for styles and the tagged template literals styled-components uses

## Quick start

Install the plugin first:

```
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-styled-components
```

Then add it to your babel configuration:

```JSON
{
  "plugins": ["babel-plugin-styled-components"]
}
```
