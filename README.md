Cucumber is a tool that supports [Behaviour-Driven Development
(BDD)](https://cucumber.io/blog/2017/05/15/intro-to-bdd-and-tdd) - a software
development process that aims to enhance software quality and reduce
maintenance costs.

Cucumber executes *executable specifications* written in [plain language](docs/gherkin.md)
and produces reports indicating whether the software behaves according to the
specification or not.

Cucumber reduces the effort to keep requirements specifications, tests and documentation
in sync - with Cucumber they are all the same documents - a single source of truth
for everyone on the team.

Cucumber is compatible with all the major software platforms.
