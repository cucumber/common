=head1 NAME

Cucumber::Messages - Library of classes to encapsulate Cucumber messages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Cucumber::Messages;

  my $loc = Cucumber::Messages::Location->new(
     line => 12, column => 26
  );
  my $loc_json = $loc->to_json;

  my $envelope = Cucumber::Messages::Envelope->from_json($serialized_envelope);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Cucumber messages|https://github.com/cucumber/common/tree/main/messages>
define the central protocol in the Cucumber ecosystem by which the various
components communicate. Messages are serialized to NDJSON.

This library provides both serialization/deserialization to/from NDJSON as
well as the in-memory representation of the messages for Perl applications.

Each serialized message should be wrapped in a C<Cucumber::Messages::Envelope>
and can thereby be deserialized by calling the C<from_json> class message
with the serialized representation as its argument, like shown in the SYNOPSIS.

package Cucumber::Messages::Attachment {

=head2 Cucumber::Messages::Attachment

=head3 DESCRIPTION

Represents the Attachment message in Cucumber's
L<message protocol|https://github.com/cucumber/common/tree/main/messages#readme>.

//// Attachments (parse errors, execution errors, screenshots, links...)

*
 An attachment represents any kind of data associated with a line in a
 [Source](#io.cucumber.messages.Source) file. It can be used for:

 * Syntax errors during parse time
 * Screenshots captured and attached during execution
 * Logs captured and attached during execution

 It is not to be used for runtime errors raised/thrown during execution. This
 is captured in `TestResult`.

=head3 ATTRIBUTES

=cut

use Moo;
extends 'Cucumber::Messages::Message';

use Scalar::Util qw( blessed );

my %types = (
   body => 'string',
   content_encoding => '',
   file_name => 'string',
   media_type => 'string',
   source => 'Cucumber::Messages::Source',
   test_case_started_id => 'string',
   test_step_id => 'string',
   url => 'string',
);

# This is a work-around for the fact that Moo doesn't have introspection
# and Perl doesn't have boolean values...
sub _types {
    return \%types;
}



=head4 body

*
 The body of the attachment. If `contentEncoding` is `IDENTITY`, the attachment
 is simply the string. If it's `BASE64`, the string should be Base64 decoded to
 obtain the attachment.

=cut

has body =>
    (is => 'ro',
     required => 1,
     default => sub { '' },
    );


=head4 content_encoding

*
 Whether to interpret `body` "as-is" (IDENTITY) or if it needs to be Base64-decoded (BASE64).

 Content encoding is *not* determined by the media type, but rather by the type
 of the object being attached:

 - string => IDENTITY
 - byte array => BASE64
 - stream => BASE64


Available constants for valid values of this field:

=over

=item * CONTENTENCODING_IDENTITY

=item * CONTENTENCODING_BASE64

=back

=cut


use constant
   CONTENTENCODING_IDENTITY => 'IDENTITY',
   CONTENTENCODING_BASE64 => 'BASE64',
   ;

has content_encoding =>
    (is => 'ro',
     required => 1,
     default => sub { CONTENTENCODING_IDENTITY },
    );


=head4 file_name

*
 Suggested file name of the attachment. (Provided by the user as an argument to `attach`)

=cut

has file_name =>
    (is => 'ro',
    );


=head4 media_type

*
 The media type of the data. This can be any valid
 [IANA Media Type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
 as well as Cucumber-specific media types such as `text/x.cucumber.gherkin+plain`
 and `text/x.cucumber.stacktrace+plain`

=cut

has media_type =>
    (is => 'ro',
     required => 1,
     default => sub { '' },
    );


=head4 source


=cut

has source =>
    (is => 'ro',
    );


=head4 test_case_started_id


=cut

has test_case_started_id =>
    (is => 'ro',
    );


=head4 test_step_id


=cut

has test_step_id =>
    (is => 'ro',
    );


=head4 url

*
 A URL where the attachment can be retrieved. This field should not be set by Cucumber.
 It should be set by a program that reads a message stream and does the following for
 each Attachment message:

 - Writes the body (after base64 decoding if necessary) to a new file.
 - Sets `body` and `contentEncoding` to `null`
 - Writes out the new attachment message

 This will result in a smaller message stream, which can improve performance and
 reduce bandwidth of message consumers. It also makes it easier to process and download attachments
 separately from reports.

=cut

has url =>
    (is => 'ro',
    );


}

package Cucumber::Messages::Duration {

=head2 Cucumber::Messages::Duration

=head3 DESCRIPTION

Represents the Duration message in Cucumber's
L<message protocol|https://github.com/cucumber/common/tree/main/messages#readme>.

The structure is pretty close of the Timestamp one. For clarity, a second type
 of message is used.

=head3 ATTRIBUTES

}



=head4 seconds


=cut

has seconds =>
    (is => 'ro',
     required => 1,
     default => sub { 0 },
    );


=head4 nanos

Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution. Negative
 second values with fractions must still have non-negative nanos values
 that count forward in time. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999
 inclusive.

=cut

has nanos =>

     required => 1,
     default => sub { 0 },

}

package Cucumber::Messages::Envelope {

=head2 Cucumber::Messages::Envelope

=head3 DESCRIPTION

Represents the Envelope message in Cucumber's
L<message protocol|https://github.com/cucumber/common/tree/main/messages#readme>.

When removing a field, replace it with reserved, rather than deleting the line.
 When adding a field, add it to the end and increment the number by one.
 See https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#updating for details

*
 All the messages that are passed between different components/processes are Envelope
 messages.

=head3 DESCRIPTION

Represents the GherkinDocument message in Cucumber's
L<message protocol|https://github.com/cucumber/common/tree/main/messages#readme>.

*
 The [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) of a Gherkin document.
 Cucumber implementations should *not* depend on `GherkinDocument` or any of its
 children for execution - use [Pickle](#io.cucumber.messages.Pickle) instead.

 The only consumers of `GherkinDocument` should only be formatters that produce
 "rich" output, resembling the original Gherkin document.

=head3 DESCRIPTION

Represents the Pickle message in Cucumber's
L<message protocol|https://github.com/cucumber/common/tree/main/messages#readme>.

//// Pickles

*
 A `Pickle` represents a template for a `TestCase`. It is typically derived
 from another format, such as [GherkinDocument](#io.cucumber.messages.GherkinDocument).
 In the future a `Pickle` may be derived from other formats such as Markdown or
 Excel files.

 By making `Pickle` the main data structure Cucumber uses for execution, the
 implementation of Cucumber itself becomes simpler, as it doesn't have to deal
 with the complex structure of a [GherkinDocument](#io.cucumber.messages.GherkinDocument).

 Each `PickleStep` of a `Pickle` is matched with a `StepDefinition` to create a `TestCase`

=head4 id
