# Cucumber HTML Formatter

The Cucumber HTML Formatter renders Cucumber features as HTML. It can optionally include
extra information such as Cucumber results, stack traces, screenshots or any other information that can be embedded
in the [Cucumber Event Protocol](../event-protocol/README.md).

It is a standalone executable that reads events from `STDIN` or a TCP socket and
writes output (HTML) to `STDOUT`, a specified directory or directly to a browser
(when run in server-mode).

(The [standard library](../docs/standard-library.adoc#implementations) list indicates
what Cucumber implementations currently support the Cucumber Event Protocol).

## Implementation

Cucumber HTML Formatter consists of two main components:

* React component (JavaScript)
* Command-line program (JavaScript / Node.js)

We may reimplement the command-line program in Go later, if it makes installation
and cross-platform usage easier. We may also consider packaging the whole thing
as a Docker image.

## Trying it out

Make sure you `cd /cucumber/html-formatter/nodejs` first.

### Build it

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm test

### Events to STDIN, HTML to STDOUT

    cat ../../event-protocol/examples/events.ndjson | bin/cucumber-html-formatter

This should print a HTML report to `STDOUT`. You probably want to direct it to a file, then
open it in a browser:

    cat ../../event-protocol/examples/events.ndjson | bin/cucumber-html-formatter > cucumber.html
    open cucumber.html

Or, you can pipe it straight to your browser if you `gem install bcat` first:

    cat ../../event-protocol/examples/events.ndjson | bin/cucumber-html-formatter | bcat

### Events via socket, HTML to browser

In the first shell:

    npm run build
    bin/cucumber-html-formatter

Now, open up a browser:

    open http://localhost:2222

And optionally, in a new shell:

    curl --header "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:2222/sse

Write some events over the socket:

    cat ../../event-protocol/examples/events.ndjson | nc localhost 2223

You should see the browser update with HTML (and if you ran `curl` you should see events there too)
