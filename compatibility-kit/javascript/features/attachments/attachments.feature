Feature: Attachments
  It is sometimes useful to take a screenshot while a scenario runs.
  Or capture some logs.

  Cucumber lets you `attach` arbitrary files during execution, and you can
  specify a content type for the contents.

  Formatters can then render these attachments in reports.

  Attachments must have a body and a content type

  Scenario: Attach text
    When the string "hello" is attached as "text/plain"

  Scenario: Attach byte array
    When an array with 10 bytes are attached as "application/octet-stream"

  Scenario: Attach byte stream
    When a JPEG image is attached
