# Release process

The release process is automated from the command line.

When a package is released, _all_ implementations of the package are released.
For example, when you release `cucumber-expressions`, it will release the Java, Ruby,
Go and JavaScript implementations of that library, with the same version number.

You *must* be on the `master` branch when you make a release. The steps below
outline the process:

* Start the docker container with secrets
* Update dependencies
* Update changelog
* Release packages

The release commands will be done from a terminal session in the Docker container.
This ensures a consistent release environment.

## Get the secrets

In order to publish packages several secrets are required. Members of the core
team can install keybase and join the `cucumberbdd` team to access these secrets.

## Start the Cucumber docker container

All commands should be made from the Cucumber docker container. Start it:

    make docker-run-with-secrets

You're now ready to make a release.

## Update changelog

Open `CHANGELOG.md` and remove any `###` headers without content. Do not commit.

No further edits should be made. The markdown headers and links will be updated
automatically in the next step.

## Decide what the next version should be

This depends on what's changed (see `CHANGELOG.md`):

* Bump `MAJOR` if:
  * There are `Changed` or `Removed` entries
  * A cucumber library dependency upgrade was major
* Bump `MINOR` if:
  * There are `Added` entries
* Bump `PATCH` if:
  * There are `Fixed` or `Deprecated` entries

## Prepare the release

    cd thepackage
    make clean

Run the `pre-release` target:

    NEW_VERSION=X.Y.Z make pre-release

This will update the package version in the package descriptor and `CHANGELOG.md`.
It will also update dependencies and verify that the build passes.

The changes made *will not* be committed to git. Examine what changed:

    git diff

Inspect the diff, and undo any changes that you think shouldn't have been made.
Make sure the package still builds, and that the tests are still passing:

    make clean && make

** Special note for html-formatter **

We need to verify that the webpacked JavaScript runs in the browser.
Run the following on your host OS (it won't work in Docker):

    make clean
    CHECK_INTEGRITY=1 make

If all is good, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, make the necessary edits
until the build passes.

## Release packages

Make sure you're in the package directory (e.g `/cucumber-expressions`).
Publish a release with the following command:

    NEW_VERSION=X.Y.Z make release

This will:

* Commit all the changed files
* Create a git tag
* Publish all the packages

Check that releases show up under:

* `https://rubygems.org/gems/[package]/versions/[version]`
* `https://www.npmjs.com/package/[package]`
* `https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:[package]` (This will take a few hours to show up)
* `https://www.nuget.org/packages/[package]/[version]`
* `https://cloud.docker.com/u/cucumber/repository/list` (If the package has a Dockerfile)

## Post release

Run the following command (using the same NEW_VERSION as you used for the release):

    NEW_VERSION=X.Y.Z make post-release

This should update the version in `java/pom.xml` file to use a `-SNAPSHOT` suffix and add
`replace` directives in the `go.mod` file.
This is automatically committed, and pushed along with the tag of the release.

If you did a new major release of a Go package, you must also update all the references in the
libraries using it:

    # Run this in the root directory
    source scripts/functions.sh && update_go_library_version libraryName X.Y.Z
