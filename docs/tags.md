# Tags

Tags are a way to group Scenarios. They are `@`-prefixed strings and you can place as many tags as you like above `Feature, Scenario, Scenario Outline` or `Examples` keywords. Space character are invalid in tags and may separate them.

Tags are inherited from parent elements. For example, if you place a tag above a `Feature`, all scenarios in that feature will get that tag.

If you want to tag all the scenarios in a feature at once, just tag the `Feature` element at the top, and all the scenarios will inherit the tag. You can still tag individual scenarios as well.

Similarly, if you place a tag above a `Scenario Outline` or `Examples` keyword, all scenarios derived from examples rows will inherit the tags.

A `Scenario` or `Feature` can have as many tags as you like. Just separate them with spaces:

```
@billing @bicker @annoy
Feature: Verify billing
```

You can tell Cucumber to only run scenarios with certain tags, or to exclude scenarios with certain tags.

Cucumber can perform different operations before and after each scenario based on what tags are present on a scenario.

There are three main reasons for tagging scenarios:

 * _Documentation_: You simply want to use a tag to attach a label to certain
 scenarios, for example to label them with an ID from a project management
 tool.
 * _Filtering_: Cucumber allows you to use tags as a filter to pick out  specific scenarios to run or report on. You can even have Cucumber fail your  test run if a certain tag appears too many times.
 * _Hooks_: Run a block of Ruby code whenever a scenario with a particular
 tag is about to start or has just finished.

See [tagged hooks](hooks.md#tagged-hooks) for more details.
