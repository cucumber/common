#Cucumber:
 
 The first question that would rise for a beginner would be 
 
  *1. What is Cucumber?*
  *2. How Cucumber works with BDD?*
  
For these two typical questions here are the answers

## What is Cucumber?

Cucumber is a [command-line tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). When you run it, it reads in your specifications from plain-language text files called features, examines them for scenarios to test, and runs the scenarios against your system. Each scenario is a list of steps for Cucumber to work through. So that Cucumber can understand these feature files, they must follow some basic syntax rules. The name for this set of rules is [Gherkin](docs/gherkin.md).
     
Along with the features, you give Cucumber a set of step definitions. These files map each business-readable language step into programming code to carry out what action shoule be performed by the step. In a mature test suite, the step definition itself will probably just be one or two lines of code that delegate to a library of support code, specific to the domain of your application.

Software teams work best when the developers and business stakeholdersare communicating clearly with one another. A great way to do that is to collaboratively specify the work that’s about to be done using automated acceptance tests.

When the acceptance tests are written as examples, they stimulate people’s imaginations and help them see other scenarios they hadn’t previously considered.

When the team write their acceptance tests collaboratively, they can develop their own ubiquitous language for talking about their problem domain. This helps them avoid misunderstandings.
    
##How Cucumber works with BDD?

This is the most typical question for every enthusiastic personality would get.
What makes Cucumber to stand out from the crowd of other communication and collaboration tools ?

Cucumber has designed specifically to ensure the acceptance tests can easily be read and written by anyone on the team. This reveals the true value of acceptance tests: as a communication and collaboration tool. The easy readability of Cucumber tests draws business stakeholders into the process, helping you really explore and understand the requirements.

Cucumber was designed specifically to help business stakeholders get involved in writing acceptance tests.

Each test case in Cucumber is called a scenario, and scenarios are grouped into features. Each scenario contains several steps.
The business-facing parts of a Cucumber test suite, stored in feature files, must be written according to syntax rules—known as Gherkin—so that Cucumber can read them.
Under the hood, step definitions translate from the business-facing language of steps into programming code.

Here is an example of a Cucumber Feature:
 
 ```gherkin 
Feature: Sign up Sign up should be quick and friendly**

Scenario: Successful sign up.  New users should get a confirmation email and greeted personally by the site once signed in.

Given I have chosen to sign up
When I sign up with valid details
Then I should receive a confirmation email
And I should see a personalized greeting message
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Duplicate email. Where someone tries to create an account for an email address that already exists.

Given I have chosen to sign up
But I specify an email address that has already registered
Then I should be told that the email is already registered
And I should be offered the option to recover my password

 ``` 
  
 Anyone from the team can go through the Feature file an can understand what is the system for, And how it works(functionality).This helps in analyzing the functionality of the system and come up with more scenarios where the system/software can be tested thoroughly.
      
In this way, we say that the story functions as a living document. As the behavior of the system evolves over time, the team is forced to evolve the documentation in parallel.
   
Acceptance tests written in this style become more than just tests,they are executable specifications along with [living documentation](living-documentation.md).
