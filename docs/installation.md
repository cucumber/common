# Installation

Cucumber exists for different platforms such as Java, JavaScript, Ruby etc. Cucumber is a command-line tool, and how you install it depends on your platform.

## Ruby {#ruby}

### Gem {#gem}

Cucumber for Ruby is a ruby gem, and can be installed from the command line. After you have installed Ruby and RubyGems, install Cucumber with the following command:

### Ruby on Rails {#rails}

Before you can use the generator, add the gem to your project's Gemfile as follows:

``` ruby
    group :test do
      gem 'cucumber-rails', :require => false
      # database_cleaner is not required, but highly recommended
      gem 'database_cleaner'
    end
```
Then install it by running:

``` shell
    bundle install
```

Learn about the various options:

``` shell
    rails generate cucumber:install --help
```

Finally, bootstrap your Rails app, for example:

``` shell
    rails generate cucumber:install
```
