## Acknowledgements

The Cucumber Expression syntax is inspired by similar expression syntaxes in
other BDD tools, such as [Turnip](https://github.com/jnicklas/turnip), [Behat](https://github.com/Behat/Behat) and [Behave](https://github.com/behave/behave).

Big thanks to Jonas Nicklas, Konstantin Kudryashov and Jens Engel for
implementing those libraries.
