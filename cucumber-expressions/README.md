# Cucumber Expressions

Cucumber Expressions are simple patterns for matching Step Definitions with
Gherkin steps.

(See the [implementations](IMPLEMENTATIONS.md) list to see if Cucumber Expressions
are what Cucumber implentations support Cucumber Expressions).

Cucumber Expressions are an alternative to [Regular Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
that are easier to read and write for humans.

This is an example of a Cucumber Expression with a single argument `{n}`:

    I have {n} cukes in my belly

This expression would match the following Gherkin step text (The `Given ` keyword has been removed):

    I have 42 cukes in my belly

When this step is matched against the expression, the `{n}` argument would get the
value `"42"` and be passed to the Step Definition's body.

## Optional text

Optional text is simply surrounded by parenthesis:

    I have {n} cuke(s) in my belly

That expression would match this text:

    I have 2 cukes in my belly

It would also match this text (note the singular cuke):

    I have 1 cuke in my belly

## Type transformations

When arguments are extracted from a successful match, they can be converted
from strings to arbitrary types. Here is an example:

    I have {n:int} cukes in my belly

In this case the argument would be converted to `42` (an integer).
When the type is not specified, no type transformation happens, and
the argument is always a string.

The types you can specify in Cucumber Expressions are `int` and `float`, and any
additional numeric types available in your programming language.

### Statically typed languages

With statically typed programming languages the argument types can be derived
from the step definition body's signature. It is therefore not necessary to
declare the type in the Cucumber Expression.

Here is an example in Java:

```
Given("I have {n} cukes in my belly", (int n) -> {
  // no need to specify {n:int}
})
```

### Custom type transformations

You can also register your own types:

{% codetabs name="Java", type="java" -%}
TransformLookup transformLookup = new TransformLookup(Locale.ENGLISH);
transformLookup.addTransform(new FunctionTransform<>(
  Currency.class,
  singletonList("[A-Z]{3}"),
  Currency::getInstance
));
{%- language name="JavaScript", type="js" -%}
const transformLookup = new TransformLookup()
transformLookup.addTransform(new Transform(
  ['currency'],
  Currency,
  ['[A-Z]{3}'],
  s => new Currency(s)
))
{%- language name="Ruby", type="rb" -%}
transform_lookup = TransformLookup.new
transform_lookup.add_transform(Transform.new(
  ['currency'],
  Currency,
  ['[A-Z]{3}'],
  lambda { |s| Currency.new(s)}
))
{%- endcodetabs %}

With this in place you'll automatically get instances of `Currency`:

    I have a {currency:currency} account

If the argument name is the same as the type name, you don't need to specify
the type name - it will be derived from the argument name instead:

    I have a {currency} account

### Implicit transforms

If you're using a statically typed language, and your type constructor accepts
a single `String` argument, then an instance of that type will be created even
if no custom transform is registered:

    I have a {color} ball

If the signature of the Step Definition is `(Color)`, then you'll get an instance
of that as long as the type has a constructor with signature `(String)`.

### Regular Expression support

Regular Expressions can be used instead of Cucumber Expressions.

Type transformation works with Regular Expressions too, as long as the expression
uses one of the argument patterns in the registered transforms.

In the `Currency` example above, the following Regular Expression would cause
automatic conversion to `Currency`:

    I have a ([A-Z]{3}) account

This also applies to the built-in conversions for `int` and `float`. The following
Regular Expression would automatically convert the argument to `int`:

    I have (\d+) cukes in my belly

## Acknowledgements

The Cucumber Expression syntax is inspired by similar expression syntaxes in
other BDD tools, such as [Turnip](https://github.com/jnicklas/turnip), [Behat](https://github.com/Behat/Behat) and [Behave](https://github.com/behave/behave).

Big thanks to Jonas Nicklas, Konstantin Kudryashov and Jens Engel for the original
implementations.
