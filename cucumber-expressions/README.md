# Cucumber Expressions

Cucumber Expressions are simple patterns for matching Step Definitions with
Gherkin steps.

Cucumber Expressions provide an alternative to [Regular Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
which is easier to read and write for humans.

The Cucumber Expression syntax is inspired by similar expression syntaxes in
other BDD tools, such as [Turnip](https://github.com/jnicklas/turnip), [Behat](https://github.com/Behat/Behat) and [Behave](https://github.com/behave/behave).

This is an example of a Cucumber expression with a single argument `{n}`:

    I have {n} cukes in my belly

This expression would match the following Gherkin step text (The `Given ` keyword has been removed):

    I have 42 cukes in my belly

When this step is matched against the expression, the `{n}` argument would get the
value `"42"` and be passed to the step definition's body.

## Optional text

Optional text is simply surrounded by parenthesis:

    I have {n} cuke(s) in my belly

This would match both this:

    I have 2 cukes in my belly

And this (singular cuke):

    I have 2 cuke in my belly

## Type transformations

Cucumber Expressions have built-in support for transformation of arguments to
arbitrary types.

### Expression types

The type of an argument can be specified within the expression:

    I have {n:int} cukes in my belly

In this case the argument would get the value `42` (an integer) instead of `"42"`
(a string).

The types you can specify in Cucumber Expressions are `int` and `float`, and any
additional numeric types available in your programming language.

### Explicit types

In statically typed programming languages the argument types can be derived
from the step definition body's parameters. Here is an example in Java:

```
Given("I have {n} cukes in my belly", (int n) -> {
})
```

### Custom type transforms

You can also register your own types:

```java
Cucumber.addTransform(new FunctionTransform<>(
  Currency.class,
  "[A-Z]{3}",
  Currency::parse
));
```
